### AudioGenre DL Classification Project
In this project I tried to use transfer learning via Resnet18 CNN for a music genre classification task.  
I used the GTZAN dataset so if you are interested in doing a simillar project you can find the relevant data here:

#### Project overview & workflow:
* Data preprocessing - spectographs, corrupted files debugging, Dataset&Dataloader configuration etc
* Model selection and training - trying 2 different approaches as shown in the main notebook
* Final Analysis - summary using confusion matrix & forward suggestions
